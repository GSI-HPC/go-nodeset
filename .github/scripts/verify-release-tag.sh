# Refuses a release tag that is not a signed statement, by a listed signer,
# about the commit being released under the name it was pushed as.
#
# The version of a release exists only in its tag, so the tag has to be a
# statement by a person holding a key rather than a label anyone with write
# access can move. Run in a checkout of the pushed tag:
#
#   GITHUB_REF_NAME  the tag that was pushed, v1.4.0
#   GITHUB_SHA       the commit the push event is about
#   ALLOWED_SIGNERS  the keys that may sign a release, in the format of git's
#                    gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile. It comes from the
#                    RELEASE_ALLOWED_SIGNERS repository variable and never
#                    from the checkout, which the tagged commit controls.
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT    optional; receives object= and commit=, the tag object
#                    and the commit that were verified.
#
# Every check fails closed: a missing signer list, a signature git cannot
# verify, and a signature by anyone else all stop the release.
